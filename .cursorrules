# Cursor Rules for Ari and Jorge Starter

## Project Instructions

All project rules, guidelines, and workflows are defined in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Cursor agents and AI assistants MUST read and follow `CLAUDE.md` before making any changes.**

## Key Guidelines from CLAUDE.md

- **Never work directly on main branch** - Always use feature branches
- **All changes require Pull Requests** - No direct pushes to main
- **Pre-commit hooks run automatically** - Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript checks
- **Branch naming conventions**: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`
- **Deployment via GitHub Actions** - Preview on PRs, Production on main merge

## Reference

See `CLAUDE.md` for complete guidelines including:
- Golden Rules
- Tech Stack
- File Structure
- Code Style Preferences
- Deployment Configuration
- Emergency Help

When in doubt, consult `CLAUDE.md` first.
