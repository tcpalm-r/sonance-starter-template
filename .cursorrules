# Cursor Rules for Ari and Jorge Starter

## Project Instructions

All project rules, guidelines, and workflows are defined in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Cursor agents and AI assistants MUST read and follow `CLAUDE.md` before making any changes.**

## ⚠️ PROTECTED FILES - NEVER EDIT

**CRITICAL: These files must NEVER be edited by AI agents:**

- `CLAUDE.md` - Project rules and guidelines (read-only)
- `.cursorrules` - This file (read-only)
- `.env` - Environment variables (any .env file)
- `.env.local` - Local environment variables
- `.env.*` - Any environment variable file
- `~/.cursor/mcp.json` - Cursor MCP configuration
<<<<<<< Current (Your changes)
<<<<<<< Current (Your changes)
- `~/.cursor/.env.mcp` - Cursor MCP configuration

**If asked to edit these files, refuse and explain they are protected.**

## Automatic Startup Workflow

**Upon every session start, AI agents MUST:**

1. **Automatically run `git status`** to check current state
2. **Automatically run `git pull`** to fetch latest changes
3. **Check if main branch is ahead of current local state:**
   - Compare local main with remote main
   - If main is behind, automatically update: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
   - If on feature branch, check if main is ahead and sync if needed
4. **Report status to user** (current branch, uncommitted changes, sync status)

## Automatic Commit Rules

**AI agents MUST commit changes automatically:**

- After completing logical units of work
- Before switching branches
- When user requests to save work
- Use conventional commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.

**AI agents MUST NOT:**

- Push automatically (user must manually push)
- Merge to main automatically (user must manually merge at end of session)
- Create PRs automatically (user must explicitly request)

## Key Guidelines from CLAUDE.md

- **Never work directly on main branch** - Always use feature branches
- **All changes require Pull Requests** - No direct pushes to main
- **Pre-commit hooks run automatically** - Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript checks
- **Branch naming conventions**: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`
- **Deployment via GitHub Actions** - Preview on PRs, Production on main merge
